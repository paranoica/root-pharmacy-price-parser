# deutsch-pharmacies-price-parser

A small **test project** written in Python for parsing pharmacy product prices.  
It's a **local prototype**, not a production-ready tool — made mostly for learning and quick experimentation.

## ⚙️ Description

This script tries to collect and display price data from a few online pharmacy sources.  
Currently, it only includes basic parsing logic and some placeholder structures — the project is **unfinished** and **non-serious**.

## 💡 Notes

- Built as part of a small test task.
- Intended for **local use only**.
- Code structure and error handling are minimal.
- Some functions may be incomplete or experimental.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
Install all needed requirements by
py -m pip install 'name'

python main.py
